# The RBY Sprites Project
A project to document all Gen 1 Pokemon sprites for easy viewing and use. This is mainly in a Pokemon Showdown format, but other canvases (especially 56x56) are intended to be made available. It does not intend to move beyond the Gen 1 / SW97 era, intending to serve as a homage to the art styles used for Satoshi Tajiri's original vision.

The following spritesets are available, in chronological order;
- Beta Pokemon material
- Red and Green
- Prototype Blue
- Blue
- SpaceWorld 1997
- Prototype Yellow
- Yellow
- May 1998 Cache
- Pocket Monsters Stadium ("Stadium Zero")
- Pokemon Stadium

While many of these are WIPs, RG, RB, SW97, and Yellow are all complete.
