# The RBY Sprites Project
A project to document all Gen 1 Pokemon sprites for easy viewing and use. This is mainly in a Pokemon Showdown format, but other canvases (especially 56x56) are intended to be made available. It does not intend to move beyond the Gen 1 / SW97 era, intending to serve as a homage to the art styles used for Satoshi Tajiri's original vision.

The following spritesets are available, in chronological order;
- Beta Pokemon material
- Red and Green
- Prototype Blue
- Blue
- SpaceWorld 1997
- Prototype Yellow
- Yellow
- May 1998 Cache
- Pocket Monsters Stadium ("Stadium Zero")
- Pokemon Stadium

The Game Boy spritesets are mainly made for use with Tampermonkey scripts on Pokemon Showdown, allowing users to mix and match the spritesets for their ideal experience.

Stadium ones are not compatible due to being GIFs. 

The following spritesets are incomplete, but have incomplete archives available for use;
* Beta Pokemon material | Original 16 & Interview sheets have not been reconstructed.
* Prototype Blue | Corocoro November & December '96 issue sprites have not been fully reconstructed; only two are done in addition to the RG Asset Leak's Blue Mew sprite.
* Pocket Monsters Stadium
* Pokemon Stadium
