# The RBY Sprites Project
A project to document all Gen 1 Pokemon sprites for easy viewing and use. This is mainly in a Pokemon Showdown format, but other canvases are made available, such as fully cropped and enlarged versions, which may be more suitable for use with other software. Additionally, versions that used a pinkish tone with a strange black, such as Red/Green/Blue, have versions restoring the original white that appeared to be intended, allowing for a less saturated look.

This project does not intend to move beyond the Gen 1 / SW97 era, intending to serve as a homage to the art styles used for Satoshi Tajiri's original vision. All material is free for use by any passers-by, so long as the repository is credited in some capacity, as literal years of effort have been put into making this archive the best it can possibly be.

The following spritesets are available, in chronological order;
* Beta Pokemon material (c. 1990)
* Red and Green (Mid-1990, released 27th February 1996)
* Prototype Blue (c. October 1996)
* Blue (15th October 1996)
* SpaceWorld 1997 (c. November 1997)
* Prototype Yellow (c. May 1998)
* Yellow (12th September 1998)
* May 1998 Cache

Additionally, model GIFs are in progress;
* Pocket Monsters Stadium ("Stadium Zero", 1st August 1998)
* Pokemon Stadium (30th April 1999)

The Game Boy spritesets are mainly made for use with Tampermonkey scripts on Pokemon Showdown, allowing users to mix and match the spritesets for their ideal experience. For more details on this, go [here](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/tampermonkey-script-for-gen-1-rb-rg-sw97-sprites-on-showdown.3694716/). Stadium model GIFs are not compatible with the Tampermonkey scripts due to the way they replace the sprites, aka repeated, rapid replacements.

The following spritesets are incomplete, but have incomplete archives available for use;
* Beta Pokemon material | Original 16 & Interview sheets have not been reconstructed.
* Prototype Blue | Corocoro November & December '96 issue sprites have not been fully reconstructed; only two are done in addition to the RG Asset Leak's Blue Mew sprite.
* Pocket Monsters Stadium
* Pokemon Stadium

The following material could arguably be added, but is currently undecided;
* CBB Scratchpad RB-like sprites from the GSC Gigaleak
* Glitch Pokemon
