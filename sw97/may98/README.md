This is a SW97 sprite package, featuring some of the redesigns featured in the May '98 sprite archive from the gigaleak. The most notable change here is Moltres's design following its RB revision, which brings it into the modern design we know today. There are quite a few with subtle differences as well.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.
- Colour-corrected versions
- 250% enlarged versions
- Cropped to sprite versions

The following Pokemon have front sprite differences from SW97;
* Butterfree
* Growlithe
* Abra
* Kadabra
* Seadra
* Magmar
* Omanyte
* Omastar
* Articuno
* Moltres

The following Pokemon have back sprite differences from SW97;
* Oddish
* Gloom
* Growlithe
* Bellsprout
* Weepinbell
* Victreebel
* Dodrio
* Goldeen
* Seaking

My archive also includes a reconstructed Gyarados front sprite from the SW '99 archive, which had old-style shading and thus led me to believe it was meant for this art style.
