This is a WIP project aiming to create a SW97 sprite package, featuring some of the redesigns featured in the May '98 sprite archive from the gigaleak. The most notable change here is Moltres's design following its RB revision, which brings it into the modern design we know today. Pokemon like Bellsprout also see alteration.
