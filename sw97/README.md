These are the Spaceworld '97 front and back sprites for the original 151, which have art styles reminiscent of the originals. In fact, some are actually still the Pocket Monsters Aoi sprites, implying some of these were meant to be in Blue in the first place.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.

WIP projects going on right now;
- A '98 version package is included, replacing SW97 Pokemon with content from the May '98 archive featured in the gigaleak. This includes some redesigns of the sprites still in the RB art style, such as an overhaul of Moltres's design into its modern rendition.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- 56x56 propotioned sprites
