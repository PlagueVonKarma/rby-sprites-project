These are the Spaceworld '97 front and back sprites for the original 151, which have art styles reminiscent of the originals. In fact, some are actually still the Pocket Monsters Aoi sprites, implying some of these were meant to be in Blue in the first place.

The following Pokemon have front sprite differences from SW97;
* Butterfree
* Growlithe
* Abra
* Kadabra
* Seadra
* Magmar
* Omanyte
* Omastar
* Articuno
* Moltres

The following Pokemon have back sprite differences from SW97;
* Oddish
* Gloom
* Growlithe
* Bellsprout
* Weepinbell
* Victreebel
* Dodrio
* Goldeen
* Seaking

It also includes a reconstructed Gyarados front sprite from the SW '99 archive, which had old-style shading and thus led me to believe it was meant for this art style.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- 56x56 propotioned sprites
