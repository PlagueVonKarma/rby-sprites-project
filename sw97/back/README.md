Some of these back sprites are actually strikingly similar to what was in Pokemon Red and Blue design-wise. It's highly likely that these were intended to be in Pocket Monsters Aoi, but got cut due to time constraints. Standout examples include Venusaur, Vaporeon, Tauros, Moltres, and the Vileplume line.
