This is a repository of Red and Green's sprites. These are the first interpretations of the original 151 that were ever released. 

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- 56x56 propotioned back sprites
- Glitch Pokemon, possibly adjusted for PS, palette, and transparency.
- Pixel-for-pixel reconstructions of Capsule Monsters prototype material (eg. the "original 16" sprite sheet, etc)
