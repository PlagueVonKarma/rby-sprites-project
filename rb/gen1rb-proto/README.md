In Corocoro Magazine's November and December 1996 issues, Pocket Monsters Aoi's sprites would first be revealed. These would eventually become known as Red and Blue's in the west. However, many of the sprites shown off were changed prior to release, and thus, no Gen 1 interpretation has these in-game.

This is a project to restore many of these sprites in a PS-compatible fashion for use with Tampermonkey scripts, as well as use them for other forms of content. 

The following Pokemon have different sprites;
- Raticate
- Fearow
- Pikachu
- Clefairy
- Persian
- Kadabra
- Alakazam
- Lickitung
- Rhydon
- Ditto
- Porygon
- Aerodactyl
- Dragonair
- Mewtwo

Currently, only Rhydon and Ditto have been completed; thanks to EyeDonutz (https://twitter.com/theeyedonutz, https://www.deviantart.com/eyedonutz)
