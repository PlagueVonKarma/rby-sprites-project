In Corocoro Magazine's November and December 1996 issues, Pocket Monsters Aoi's sprites would first be revealed. These would eventually become known as Red and Blue's in the west. However, many of the sprites shown off were changed prior to release, and thus, no Gen 1 interpretation has these in-game.

You can find high-quality scans done by myself here: https://tcrf.net/Prerelease:Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue#Early_Pok.C3.A9mon_Blue_Sprites

This is a project to restore many of these sprites in a PS-compatible fashion for use with Tampermonkey scripts, as well as use them for other forms of content. These would be pixel-perfect, with the odd speculative thing done to try and complete them where necessary (eg. Rhydon's arm).

The following Pokemon have different sprites;
- Raticate
- Fearow
- Pikachu
- Clefairy
- Persian
- Kadabra
- Alakazam
- Lickitung
- Rhydon
- Ditto
- Porygon
- Aerodactyl
- Dragonair
- Mewtwo

Currently, only Rhydon and Ditto have been completed; thanks to EyeDonutz (https://twitter.com/theeyedonutz, https://www.deviantart.com/eyedonutz)
