This is a repository of Red and Blue's sprites. These sprites were first designed shortly after Red and Green were released, improving upon Red and Green's material. This was what the west got first.

For the back sprites, go to the RG folder. RB made no alterations to these and it's best not to inflate file size by cloning them.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.

It also has the following WIP projects;
- 56x56 front sprite archive, slowly replacing a clone of yellow's folder.
- Reconstructions of the Corocoro November and December 1996 prototype front sprites; current two were done by EyeDonutz.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- 56x56 propotioned back sprites
- Glitch Pokemon, possibly adjusted for PS, palette, and transparency.
