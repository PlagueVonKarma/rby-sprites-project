The 2018 gigaleak featured many old revisions of Yellow front sprites from when its development was just starting. Many of these feature different poses, old ideas, or simply less refined stuff. 

I worked on a bunch of these here, but never put them into a proper PS canvas or anything: https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/plagues-spritework-funhouse.3667571/post-8579433

Basically just need a moment of motivation to do it.
