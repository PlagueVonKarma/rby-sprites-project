This is a repository of Yellow's sprites. Yellow uses its own set of palettes and features Pokemon redesigned according to the anime and Ken Sugimori's specifications. They began development in roughly May 1998 before being released on 12th September 1998.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites, with the original bright palette.
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.
- 56x56 proportioned front sprites, which have better compatability with applications that like to anti-alias them.
- 250% enlarged versions
- Cropped to sprite versions
- Both the classic and Virtual Console Jynx sprites.
- Sprite packs containing the prototype Yellow sprites from the gigaleak.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- 56x56 propotioned back sprites
- SGB palette sprites, which are noticeably more washed out.
- Glitch Pokemon, possibly adjusted for PS, palette, and transparency.
- Minimize
