This is a repository of Yellow's sprites. Yellow uses its own set of palettes and features Pokemon redesigned according to the anime and Ken Sugimori's specifications.

As of now, my archive has the following;
- The standard front and back sprites, with the original bright palette.
- PS-compatible canvases, many of which had transparency edits done by myself.
- 56x56 proportioned front sprites, which have better compatability with applications that like to anti-alias them.
- Both the classic and Virtual Console Jynx sprites.

Things I'd like to add down the line;
- Sprite packs containing the prototype Yellow sprites, a few of which you can find here; https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/plagues-spritework-funhouse.3667571/post-8579433
- 56x56 propotioned back sprites
- SGB palette sprites, which are noticeably more washed out.
