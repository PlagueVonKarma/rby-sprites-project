These are technically extracted using Stadium 2's unused Model Viewer, but they're the exact same models. Credits go to MeepBard for extracting these.

The models here are intended for use on Pokemon Showdown's sprite index, which would then become usable on its platform. Thus, compressed models are what's used, with small resolution and such.

More contributors would be swell for this.
